## Generations

The Porsche Taycan has gone through two main generations since its introduction:

- **First Generation (2019-2023)**: The first-generation Porsche Taycan was introduced as Porsche's first all-electric vehicle. It featured an 800-volt electrical system architecture, dual permanent magnet synchronous motors (in most variants), and various trim levels including Taycan, 4S, Turbo, and Turbo S. Power output ranged from approximately 402 hp in the base model to 750 hp in the Turbo S with overboost. The first generation also introduced the Cross Turismo and Sport Turismo body styles in 2021, offering more utility with a wagon-like design.

- **Second Generation (2024-present)**: The second-generation Taycan received a comprehensive update with improved electric motors, battery technology, and charging capabilities. The updated models feature increased range, faster charging times, and enhanced performance metrics across all variants. The second generation maintains the same body styles (sedan, Cross Turismo, and Sport Turismo) while incorporating updated exterior styling, improved thermal management, and more advanced driver assistance systems. Power output increased across the lineup, with the top Turbo S model producing over 940 hp with launch control engaged.
